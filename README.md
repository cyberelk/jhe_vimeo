# jhe_vimeo

jhe_vimeo is an extension for TYPO3 CMS that provides the ability to display Vimeo videos in TYPO3.
The videos database records are stored in a system folder and can be displayed anywhere on standard TYPO3 pages in the page tree via plugin content elements.
The extension also provides a plugin for displaying video lists.
These are own database records that store relations to before created video records.

Because of the internal need for this functionality this version of the extension is optimized <strong>only</strong> for TYPO3 4.5LTS. But version for 6.2LTS and 7.6LTS will follow at short hand.
